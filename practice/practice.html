    <p>
      Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca">molluscs</a> of the order
      Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid,
      octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the
      cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles
      furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey.
      They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the
      largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20
      in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and
      other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals,
      seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
      cuttlefish is about 1&ndash;2 years. Studies are said to indicate
      cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish
      also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
      invertebrates.[4]
    </p>

    <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and
      temperate ocean waters. They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
      they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an
      unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East
      and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all
      coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.
      By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North
      Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water
      species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found
      in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may
      occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths,
      between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about
      180 m (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category
      of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means
      that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in
      some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic
      range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean acidification,
      however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into
      the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]

    <h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Visual System</h3>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The
      organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally
      differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial
      similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be
      examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly
      curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they
      can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of
      contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their
      retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more
      backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire
      lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in
      mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the
      optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They are capable of using
      stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their brain
      calculates the input from both eyes.[18][19]
    </p>

    <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is
      porous and is made of aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which
      the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the
      chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[22] Each species'
      cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture.
      The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that
      distinguish them from their squid relatives.[23]
